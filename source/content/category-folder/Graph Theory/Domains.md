# What are they:
Domains are the things you put on graphs, or more succinctly stated from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function: 

	In mathematics, the domain of a function is the set of inputs accepted by the function. It is sometimes denoted by dom(f) or dom_f, where f is the function. In layman's terms, the domain of a function can generally be thought of as "what x can be"
	
In other words, the domain is the answer to the question "what measurement system does the X axis belong to?"


# Examples

Common domains include:
+ Time
+ Position
+ Temperature
+ Frequency
+ Energy
Its important to remember that these domains are fundamental. This means that some of these domains can be expanded on. For example Kinetic energy is a form of energy just as well as Potential energy. 
This can often lead to confusion with units, for example Work is a domain who has units of N-m or Jules and is a measure of. force acting through a distance. Similarly Torque is a measure of force acting at a distance through a line of action. Although this has units of N-m it is not part of the energy domain but the Torque domain. It could also be considered to be part of the Work domain since work is a requirement of torque. 
It's best not to over think this but you can see how units are connected to domains, and how domains can be intertwined. At the end of the day, what is the thing on the X axis.
