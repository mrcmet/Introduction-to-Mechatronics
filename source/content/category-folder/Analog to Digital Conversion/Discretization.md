# What is is:
The amplitude domain can take any range of units; voltage, current, temperature, velocity... The key takeaway is that in any real physical phenomenon things can take an infinite range of values. As discussed in advanced mathematics classes an infinite number of numbers is a very very large set of numbers with infinitely small spacing in between.
